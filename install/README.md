# Install

## System Requirements

Not much is required, 10 GB disk space should be more than enough for personal use.

**Docker** is the only recommended install method, and using **docker-compose** you'll be setup within seconds.

## Browser support

Internet Explorer is not supported. All other major browsers should work.

## Docker

Right now we only support **Docker** for installation, see [here](with-docker.md)
