# FAQ

### Why selfhosted?

Because I'd like my data to be owned by me and not a company - and you should to.

### What does it cost?

It's free. But you're welcome to donate to help keep the project evolving.

### How can I help?

You can contribute by code, see [Contrubting](contributing.md) - or find bugs and reporting them via Github.  
Tell your friends and tweet about it.

### How can I backup my data?

You can manually take a mysqldump of the database, or you can use the "Export" button in "User settings" to export all your notes as html files.
